# RiptheRep
RiptheRep Chrome Extension 0.5

This extension unlocks the content of the articles on https://rep.repubblica.it and removes the 5 articles per day limit on https://www.ilsole24ore.com.

# Usage
Add the extension to Chrome:
- Clone/download the repository
- Go to your extensions settings page
- Enable Developer Mode
- Click on "Load unpacked extension" and select the folder where you cloned this repository

The extension works straight away, begin browsing :)
If the paywall is still there, please try reloading the page!

# TODO
- when the user moves from a page to another, the page must be reloaded in order to remove the paywall
- find another way to inject the script when the page is loaded, setTimeOut() might not work for everyone
- ~~find a safer way to select the right nodes to edit~~
